# To start the Program
`All 4 Algorithms require 4 parameters -inst -alg -time -seed, even if some algorithm do not need all of them`
## For BnB
```python
python3 starter.py -inst ./DATA/DATASET/large_scale/large_10 -alg BnB -time 1 -seed 5 
```
### The program will write the result trace file in BnB_trace and solution file in BnB_sol.
## For LS1(Simulated Annealing)

## For LS2(Hill Alimbing)

## For Approximation Algorithm
